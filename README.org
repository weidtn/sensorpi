* Introduction
A program to read different sensor's data connected to for example a raspberry pi and send it to an influxdb.

* Configuration
All configuration is done in the config.edn file.
If you add a sensor here, it will automatically be read by the program and added to the measurement.
InfluxDB data also has to be set up in here it defaults to a local installation on the same raspberry pi without any authentication. To use a remote InfluxDB, change the URL in the config file.

* Supported sensors
Currently the following sensors are supported:

- Camera (Integrating histogram, save image)
- DHT11
- DS18B20
- TSL2591
- BMP280 (I2C, SPI)
- BME280 (I2C)

Multiple sensors should work if different addresses (I2C) or pins (SPI) are used.
